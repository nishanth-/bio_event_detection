Description

    Using my division of the GENIA 1.0 trees available from

        http://bllip.cs.brown.edu/download/genia1.0-division-rel1.tar.gz

    I repeated my self-training experiments in our ACL 2008 paper using
    GENIA 1.0 trees as the labeled data. This also allowed me to create
    a GENIA reranker. The results (on the dev set from my division)
    are quite dramatic:

    [2] This model (please cite my thesis, forthcoming) 

Contents

    The first-stage/ directory is a parsing model for the Charniak parser.
    The second-stage/ directory includes a list of features and their weights.

Example usage sketch
    
    FILETOPARSE=<fill this in>
    RERANKINGPARSER=<fill this in, should have first-stage/ and second-stage
        as subdirs>
    BIOPARSINGMODEL=<this directory>

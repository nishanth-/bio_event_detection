Validation, Evaluation and Visualization Software for BioNLP'13 Shared Task on Event Extraction -- Gene Regulation Network task


- Contains a script for validating GRN data, evaluating predictions against a reference and generating a SIF file (for cytoscape)




Contents
--------

    GRN.py
    bionlpst.py

The GRN.py is a multi-purpose script that allows to:
        - validate .a1 and .a2 files against the BioNLP-ST format and against the GRN task annotation schema
        - evaluate .a2 files generated by a prediction system against a reference annotation
        - generate a Cytoscape .sif file corresponding to a set of .a2 files (reference or predicted)

The bionlpst.py file is a library of common routines to parse and check files in BioNLP-ST format. This file must be located in the same directory than GRN.py. The python runtime generates a file named bionlpst.pyc, this is normal and this file is not required (since the runtime will re-generate it).





Requirements
------------

You must have Python version 2.4 or more recent in order to run this script.





Usage
-----

	./GRN [options] FILES

Where FILES is the set of `*.txt' files to check. In GRN each file contains a sentence of a PubMed abstract.

Options:

	--a1-dir DIR
	Specifies the path to the directory containg the `.a1' files. The script expects a `.a1' file for each `.txt' file provided as argument.

	--a2-dir DIR
	Specifies the path to the directory containg the `.a2' files. The script expects a `.a1' file for each `.txt' file provided as argument.

	--silence IGNOREFILE
	Specifies a file containing the exact string of error messages the script should ignore. This is useful if your output does not conform exactly to the GRN annotation schema and wish to proceed anyway. Use at your own risk.

	--interactions-dir DIR
	Specifies the path to a directory where the script should write `.a2' files containing resolved Interaction relations. For more details about Interaction resolution, see https://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst2013/tasks/gene-regulation-network.

	--sif FILE
	Specifies a file where the script writes the resolved genic regulation network corresponding to the annotation specified by --a1-dir and --a2-dir. The file is in SIF format, readable as is by Cytoscape.

	--pred-dir DIR
	Computes the SER score of `.a2' files in the specified directory against reference annotations.

	--pred-sif FILE
	Computes the SER score of the specified `.sif' file containing a predicted network against the reference annotations.

	--verbose
	When evaluating, prints the source of erroneous predicted arcs.





Examples
--------

    * Resolving interactions, because my prediction method only handlesrelations between entities

        ./GRN --a1-dir TRAIN_DIR --a2-dir TRAIN_DIR --interactions-dir NEWTRAIN_DIR TRAIN_DIR/PMID-*.txt

	TRAIN_DIR is the directory containing the training data (or development data).
	NEWTRAIN_DIR is the directory where you want the new `.a2' files.


    * Validating the predicted data

        ./GRN --a1-dir TRAIN_DIR --a2-dir PRED_DIR TRAIN_DIR/PMID-*.txt

	PRED_DIR is the directory containing the predicted data.


    * Generating a SIF file for the training data

        ./GRN --a1-dir TRAIN_DIR --a2-dir TRAIN_DIR --sif SIFFILE TRAIN_DIR/PMID-*.txt

	TRAIN_DIR is the directory containing the training data (or development data).
	SIFFILE name of the file to generate


    * Generating a SIF file for the predicted interactions

        ./GRN --a1-dir TRAIN_DIR --a2-dir PRED_DIR --sif SIFFILE TRAIN_DIR/PMID-*.txt

	PRED_DIR is the directory containing the predicted data.
	SIFFILE name of the file to generate


    * Evaluating predictions in `.a2' format

        ./GRN --a1-dir TRAIN_DIR --a2-dir TRAIN_DIR --pred-dir PRED_DIR TRAIN_DIR/PMID-*.txt

	TRAIN_DIR is the directory containing the training data (or development data).
	PRED_DIR is the directory containing the predicted data.


    * Evaluating my predictions with full error analysis

        ./GRN --a1-dir TRAIN_DIR --a2-dir TRAIN_DIR --pred-dir PRED_DIR --verbose TRAIN_DIR/PMID-*.txt

	TRAIN_DIR is the directory containing the training data (or development data).
	PRED_DIR is the directory containing the predicted data.


    * Evaluating my predictions in `.sif' format

        ./GRN --a1-dir TRAIN_DIR --a2-dir TRAIN_DIR --pred-sif SIFFILE TRAIN_DIR/PMID-*.txt

	TRAIN_DIR is the directory containing the training data (or development data).
	SIFFILE name of the file containing the predicted network

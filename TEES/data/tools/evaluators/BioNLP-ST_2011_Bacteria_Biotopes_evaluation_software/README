Changes in release 18 Feb 2011:
  * fixed a bug that yielded message "SEVERE: role Host does not allow entity of type Host"

Changees in release 01 Mar 2011:
  * precision takes into account all predicted events (and not only partial and total matches)


Usage:
  java -jar BioNLP-ST_2011_Bacteria_Biotopes_evaluation_software.jar REFDIR PREDDIR

where REFDIR is the directory containing the reference annotation files (including .txt, .a1 and .a2),
and  PREDDIR is the directory containing the predicted annotation files (.a2 files only).

The program will complain about missing or extra files (if any) in PREDDIR, or if any file does not parse correctly. It will also output the recall, precision and f-measure.

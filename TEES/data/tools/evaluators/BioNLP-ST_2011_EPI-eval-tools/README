This package contains the evaluation tools for the BioNLP Shared Task 2011
Epigenetics and Post-translational Modifications (EPI) main task.

For a description of the task, please see the task homepage

    http://2011.bionlp-st.org/home/epigenetics-and-post-translational-modifications

There are three scripts in this package:

- evaluation.py : evaluation script
- config.py     : evaluation settings
- subset.py     : script for generating an annotation subset

This is a beta release of these scripts, which have been developed and
tested only on a single architecture. Please allow for possible remaining
problems and report any errors, surprising results or other issues to
sampo.pyysalo@gmail.com.

Usage:

Given the reference (gold) annotations in the directory gold/ and
predicted annotations in the directory submission/, evaluation using
the primary EPI full task criteria can be performed as

    python evaluation.py -s -p -r gold submission/*.a2

where "-s" specifies "soft" (approximate) boundary matching, "-p"
partial recursive matching, and "-r" identifies the directory with the
reference data.

To perform evaluation of the "core" EPI task under the same criteria,
it is necessary to first prepare the core subset of both the reference
data and (if any non-core annotations are predicted) the predicted
annotations, e.g. as follows (assuming bash shell)

    cp -r gold gold-core
    cp -r submission submission-core
    for d in gold-core submission-core; do
        python subset.py -s core -m -a Site,Sidechain,Contextgene $d/*.a2   
    done

this will create for each .a2 file in the directories gold-core/ and
submission-core/ a corresponding .a2.core file where events have been
stripped of extra arguments (Site,Sidechain and Contextgene) and
modifications (Negation and Speculation).

The original .a2 files can then be replaced with the core ones in these
directories with e.g.

    for d in gold-core submission-core; do
        for f in $d/*.a2.core; do
            mv $f ${f%.core};
        done
    done

and evaluation can then be run normally

    python evaluation.py -s -p -r gold-core submission-core/*.a2

the script also supports the "single partial penalty" evaluation
criterion ("-1" option) as well as an experimental feature for
generating a merge of the submission and gold annotations for visual
comparison ("-o" option). Files generated with the -o option can be
visualized with the BioNLP Shared Task annotation visualization tool

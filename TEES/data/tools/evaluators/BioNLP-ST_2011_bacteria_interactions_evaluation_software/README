BioNLP Shared Tasks 2011

Bacteria Interactions evaluation software


Usage:
  java -jar BioNLP-ST_2011_bacteria_interactions_evaluation_software.jar REFDIR PREDDIR

where REFDIR is the directory containing the reference annotation files (including .txt, .a1 and .a2),
and  PREDDIR is the directory containing the predicted annotation files (.a2 files only).

The program will complain about missing or extra files (if any) in PREDDIR, or if any file does not parse correctly. It will also output the recall, precision and f-measure for each event type and one set of scores for theall types together.

Participants will have two rankings: one for the global F-score and one for the Interaction event type F-score.

- version: 1.0
- release: 8 Nov, 2010


This package includes the following files:

README.txt		This file.
CRScorer.jar		Evaluation program
Example			A folder contains example input and output files.
Example/testgold	A folder contains gold files ( *.txt, *.a1, *.a2)
Example/testresp	A folder contains response files ( *.a2)
Example/testresult	A folder contains two output files: eval.results and eval.details


[USAGE]

java -jar [-mention=strict|partial] [-link=atom|surface]
          [-recall=system|algorithm] [-details] [gold_dir] [test_dir] [results_dir]

Default: -mention=partial
         -link=atom
         -recall=system

Parameters:

gold_dir   : contains gold files (*.txt, *.a1, and *.a2 files)
test_dir   : contains files to be evaluated (*.a2 files)
result_dir : contains the results of evaluation
     * result_dir/eval.results	contains evaluation results
     * result_dir/eval.details	contains details of evaluation results


Options:

-link=surface	  : links are evaluated based on all the gold links given in a2 files
-link=atom	  : links are evaluated based on atom links generated from surface links
-mention=strict	  : spans are evaluated based on their exact boundaries
-mention=partial  : spans are evaluated considering their max/min boundaries.
-recall=system	  : the recall of evaluation is calculated based on the total number of links
-recall=algorithm : the links that cannot be found due to failture of span recognition is removed before link evaluation.
-details	  : tells it to produce the eval.details, which shows the details of evaluation.
